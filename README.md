# Library Database Application
## Made By: Andy Liu, Shahmat Uzaer Reza Nafee

**Instructions To Run:** 
To run the Python file, you must have a working installation of Python. The standard Python library includes the sqlite3 module already so once Python is installed, the program should run properly.

**Design:**
The database was designed to follow BCNF meaning each relation is in BCNF form. The proof is included in the attached PDF file. Details on the database schema and the E/R diagram of the database are also included in the PDF.

**Functionality:**
This application has features such as finding items, borrowing items, registering for library events etc. which directly modifies information in the database file.
